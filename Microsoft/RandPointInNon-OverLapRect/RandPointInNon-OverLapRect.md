This code is designed to randomly pick a point from multiple given rectangles, ensuring that all points across all rectangles are chosen with equal probability. Here’s an explanation of the problem, approach, code, and a dry run.

---

### **Problem**
Given a list of rectangles, you need to randomly pick a point from any of the rectangles. The rectangles are represented as \([x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2]\), where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the bottom-left corner and \((x_2, y_2)\) is the top-right corner.

- All points in the rectangles should have equal probability of being selected.
- Rectangles can have different areas, so rectangles with larger areas should have a proportionally higher chance of contributing points.

---

### **Approach**
1. **Preprocessing**: 
   - Compute the total number of points in all rectangles.
   - Store cumulative sums of point counts for each rectangle to efficiently determine which rectangle to sample from.
   
2. **Random Selection**:
   - Generate a random number in the range \([0, \text{total} - 1]\).
   - Use **binary search** to find which rectangle this random number corresponds to based on the cumulative sums.
   
3. **Point Selection in Rectangle**:
   - For the chosen rectangle, generate a random point within its bounds.

---

### **Code Explanation**
1. **Initialization (`Solution` Constructor)**:
   - `rects`: Stores the input list of rectangles.
   - `total`: Tracks the total number of points across all rectangles.
   - `sum`: Stores the cumulative sum of points for each rectangle.

2. **Picking a Point (`pick` Method)**:
   - Generate a random target using `r.nextInt(total)`.
   - Use binary search on the `sum` list to locate the rectangle corresponding to the target.
   - Randomly generate a point within the chosen rectangle’s bounds.

---

### **Dry Run**

#### **Input**
Rectangles:
```
rects = [[1, 1, 3, 3], [4, 4, 6, 6]]
```
This represents:
- Rectangle 1: Points from \((1, 1)\) to \((3, 3)\), with area \(3 \times 3 = 9\).
- Rectangle 2: Points from \((4, 4)\) to \((6, 6)\), with area \(3 \times 3 = 9\).

#### **Constructor**
1. Compute areas and cumulative sums:
   - Rectangle 1: Area \(= 9\), cumulative sum \(= 9\).
   - Rectangle 2: Area \(= 9\), cumulative sum \(= 18\).
2. Total points: \(18\).
3. `sum = [9, 18]`.

---

#### **Pick Method**
1. Random target: Suppose `r.nextInt(18)` generates `target = 13`.

2. Binary search on `sum`:
   - `lo = 0`, `hi = 1`.
   - `mid = 0`.
   - Since `13 >= sum[0] (9)`, update `lo = 1`.
   - Result: Rectangle 2 is selected.

3. Generate random point in Rectangle 2:
   - Rectangle 2 bounds: \((4, 4)\) to \((6, 6)\).
   - Random `x = r.nextInt(3)` generates `1`.
   - Random `y = r.nextInt(3)` generates `2`.
   - Result: Point \((4 + 1, 4 + 2) = (5, 6)\).

---

### **Output**
Randomly selected point: `(5, 6)`.

This process ensures all points in all rectangles are chosen with equal probability.

  

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    // Stores the list of rectangles
    int[][] rects;
    // Random object for generating random numbers
    Random r = new Random();
    // Total number of points across all rectangles
    int total = 0;
    // Cumulative sum of points for each rectangle
    List<Integer> sum = new ArrayList<>();

    // Constructor: Preprocesses the input rectangles
    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        this.rects = rects;
        // Calculate the cumulative sum of points for each rectangle
        for (int[] rect : rects) {
            // Area (number of points) of the current rectangle
            int points = (rect[2] - rect[0] + 1) * (rect[3] - rect[1] + 1);
            total += points; // Update total points
            sum.add(total);  // Add to cumulative sum list
        }
    }

    // Method to pick a random point
    public int[] pick() {
        // Generate a random target in the range [0, total - 1]
        int target = r.nextInt(total);

        // Binary search to find the rectangle corresponding to the target
        int lo = 0, hi = rects.length - 1;
        while (lo < hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            // If the target is greater than or equal to the sum at mid, move to the right
            if (target >= sum.get(mid)) lo = mid + 1;
            else hi = mid; // Otherwise, move to the left
        }

        // Rectangle found at index 'lo'
        int[] rect = rects[lo];
        int x1 = rect[0], y1 = rect[1];
        int x2 = rect[2], y2 = rect[3];

        // Generate a random point within the bounds of the selected rectangle
        int x = r.nextInt(x2 - x1 + 1); // Random offset for x
        int y = r.nextInt(y2 - y1 + 1); // Random offset for y

        // Return the random point
        return new int[]{x1 + x, y1 + y};
    }
}
```

### **Key Features**
1. **Constructor (`Solution`)**:
   - Precomputes the total number of points and a cumulative sum of points across rectangles.
   - This preprocessing step allows efficient rectangle selection during the `pick` method.

2. **Point Selection (`pick`)**:
   - **Binary Search**: Efficiently locates the rectangle for the random target.
   - **Random Offset**: Generates a random offset to pick a point within the selected rectangle.

### **Usage Example**
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[][] rects = {{1, 1, 3, 3}, {4, 4, 6, 6}};
    Solution obj = new Solution(rects);

    // Example: Picking random points
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(obj.pick())); // Random point
    System.out.println(Arrays.toString(obj.pick())); // Random point
}
```
